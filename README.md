# AdoptMe

## Overview

Our application is a website for admins to review applications and add pets for adoption. This site provides functionality for admins to view adoption applicants, add new applicants, view pets up for adoption and add new pets up for adoption.

When an animal is posted to the server, users can browse the animal's profile and submit an application for review.

## User Story

AS a pet adoption admin
I WANT a site that recieves and creates profiles for pets. The profile includes the animal's name, breed, photo, and description
SO THAT clients can view different animals to consider adopting
I WANT clients to have the ability to submit applications
SO THAT our admin team can match the right client to the right pet.
